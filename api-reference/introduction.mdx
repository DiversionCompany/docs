<Note>
  If you're not looking to build a new client or a custom integration, you probably
  want to look at the [Quickstart](/quickstart) guide.

## Welcome

This section describes client-facing APIs. Diversion's native clients and web app use these endpoints. Server-side APIs
are coming soon, if you want early preview access [contact us](mailto:hello@diversion.dev).

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
