    ## Open your repo
    
    After creating a new repo, you will be taken to a tutorial that takes you through installation instructions, to work from your local machine. You can skip those if you only want to use the webapp. Simply select the new repo from the dropdown menu at the top:
    <img alt="Select Repo" style={{width: '90%', borderRadius: '1.5rem', border: '.3rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} src="/images/select-repo.jpg" />

    ## Create a workspace

    Uncommitted work is stored and synced across devices in workspaces.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a workspace" icon="laptop-file">
        Select Create New Workspace from the Branch dropdown at the top. Give it a name and click Create.
        <img alt="Create Workspace" style={{width: '90%', borderRadius: '1.5rem', border: '.3rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} src="/images/branch-dropdown.jpg" />
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create a directory (optional)" icon="folder">
        Optionally, create a directory in your workspace to add hierarchical structure to your repo.
        <img alt="Create Directory" style={{width: '90%', borderRadius: '1.5rem', border: '.3rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} src="/images/create-folder.jpg" />
      </Step>
      <Step title="Upload content" icon="upload">
        There are two options for uploading content to your workspace from the webapp:
        <AccordionGroup>
          <Accordion title="Drag and drop">
            Drag and drop a file from Finder/Explorer into the left pane of the webapp
            <img alt="Drag and drop a file" style={{width: '90%', borderRadius: '1.5rem', border: '.3rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} src="/images/drag-drop.jpg" />
          </Accordion>
          <Accordion title="The upload icon">
            Click the Upload icon
            <img alt="Upload file button" style={{width: '90%', borderRadius: '1.5rem', border: '.3rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} src="/images/upload-button.jpg" />
            Then select a target directory for your file and click Upload:
            <img alt="Select directory" style={{width: '90%', borderRadius: '1.5rem', border: '.3rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} src="/images/select-directory.jpg" />
          </Accordion>
        </AccordionGroup>
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ## Commit your changes

    After uploading some content or making changes to a workspace, we probably want to commit and make the content accessible in the branch we are working on.
    
    Simply type a commit message describing your changes, select the files to commit, and click Commit:
    <img alt="Commit" style={{width: '90%', borderRadius: '1.5rem', border: '.3rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} src="/images/commit.jpg" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    ## Clone a repo

    If you have previously created a repo (either from the web app or the CLI on another machine), and want to sync it
    locally, run:
    ```bash
    dv clone [repo_name]
    ```
    which will create a directory named `repo_name` where the contents will be synced to. To use a different name
    for the directory, run:
    ```bash
    dv clone [repo_name] [dir_name]
    ```

    ## Commit your changes

    After uploading some content or making changes to a workspace, we probably want to commit and make the content
    accessible in the branch we are working on. Assuming all files are required for the commit, run:
    ```bash
    dv commit -a -m "[commit message]"
    ```
    Alternatively to only commit some of the files, run:
    ```bash
    dv commit [[file1] [file2] ...] -m "[commit message]"
    ```
