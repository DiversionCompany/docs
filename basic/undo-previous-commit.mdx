Committed some changes and wish you hadn't? No worries, you can undo a previous commit with the `revert` command. This will prepare a commit that is the negative of the commit you want to undo.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to your repo history">
    Open the workspace of the repo where your changes are. Make sure that you have no pending changes. On the left-hand side, click on the "History" tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select commit to revert">
    Click on the menu icon next to the commit you want to revert, and select "Undo this commit". In the modal window, click "Undo changes". It's possible you'll have to resolve a merge conflict, see below.
    <img src="/images/revert-undo-commit.png" alt="Undo commit" style={{width: '90%', borderRadius: '1.5rem', border: '.3rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Admire your work">
    You'll see new changes in your workspace that undo the changes for your commit.

    In this example, this is the commit I chose to undo:
    <img src="/images/example-commit-reverted.png" alt="Reverted commit" style={{width: '90%', borderRadius: '1.5rem', border: '.3rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} />

    And this is the resulting change in my workspace:
    <img src="/images/example-commit-reverted-outcome.png" alt="Workspace after commit revert" style={{width: '90%', borderRadius: '1.5rem', border: '.3rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolve a merge conflict?">
    If you try to revert a commit that affects a file that was also affected by a later commit, it will result in a merge conflict. You'll have to resolve the conflict before you can commit the changes.

    Earlier, I reverted a file that was edited. Now, instead, I'll try to revert an earlier commit - the one where the file was created.
    <img src="/images/example-commit-reverted-with-merge.png" alt="Workspace after commit revert" style={{width: '90%', borderRadius: '1.5rem', border: '.3rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} />

    This will result in a merge conflict, which you'll have to resolve before you can commit the changes.

  </Step>
