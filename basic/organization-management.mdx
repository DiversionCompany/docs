In Diversion, an organization is a group of users who share repositories, making it easier to collaborate and manage projects.

## Creating an organization

Right now, an organization is created automatically for you when you cross into a paying tier.
For the Indie tier, an organization will be created when you invite the 5th collaborator (6th user) to a repository.
For the Educational License, an organization will be created when you invite the 10th collaborator (11th user) to a repository.
Pro tier users always have an organization.

## Managing an organization

Each organization has an owner. The owner can invite other users to join the organization, giving them access to the organization's repositories.
When you add a user to your organization, they will have access to all the repositories owned by the organization.

When inviting a user, the owner can decide if the user should have admin privileges. Admins can also manage users, same as the owner.

The difference between the owner and an admin is that billing for the organization is managed through the owner's Diversion account.

### Removing users

The owner or admins can also remove users from the organization. When removing a user, you'll be prompted with the list of repositories the user can access. These are all of the repositories that the user will no longer have access to.

This means that the Diversion agent will no longer sync these repositories with the user's workspace. This also means that the user will keep stale copies of the repositories that were previously cloned locally.

Removing a user that owns repositories is currently not supported through the app. You'll have to contact support to transfer ownership of those repositories before removing the user.

## Working in an organization

When you're a member of an organization and you create a new repository, it will be automatically assigned to your organization. This ensures that all repositories are properly organized and accessible to the relevant team members.

Other than that, working as part of an organization is exactly the same as working as an individual user.

## FAQs

### What happens to my repositories if I'm a member of multiple organizations?

From reviewing our user base, this is a pretty rare case. If you're a member of multiple organizations, when you create a new repository, it won't be automatically assigned to any repo. Right now, if you want to assign a repository to an organization, you'll have to contact support.
