**Repositories**

A repository is your project's container; it hosts all the assets, including art, code, audio, etc. Multiple collaborators can work on the same repository contributing with new assets, or modifying existing ones.


**Branches**

Branches allow you to work safely on features, tests, etc., without disrupting the work of your collaborators. 

The general workflow for branching is as follows:
* Create a new branch from the main branch (ie. gameplay-test)
* Work on changes, auditions, deletions and commit them to the branch.
* Once ready, merge them to the main branch.
* Delete the branch you created.


**Workspaces**

Finally, workspaces. A workspace is a mechanism that allows each team member to keep their work synced across devices and with the cloud. For example, you’re modifying script Enemy.cs in your local machine, Diversion, will keep that file synced to the cloud (in your workspace), so even if you don’t commit it the file is already synced.

Repositories are unique to each contributor, and for now, can’t be shared.

A workspace is linked to branch, but you can switch the branch it is linked to.
