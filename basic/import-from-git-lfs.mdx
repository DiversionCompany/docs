Importing an existing repo from Git with LFS configured is very similar to importing a regular Git repo, with a few
small differences that will be explained below.

## Importing a Git LFS repo
The basic steps to import a Git LFS repo are the same as importing a regular Git repo.
See the [Import from Git](/basic/import-from-git) page for more information.

## Considerations for Git LFS
When importing a Git LFS repo, there are a few things to keep in mind:

### Supported storage backend
Diversion currently only supports Github as a storage backend for Git LFS. If your files are hosted on a different
Git LFS storage backend, please [contact us](https://www.diversion.dev/contact-us), drop in
our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/HDAGJvgkuT) or [email us](mailto:hi@diversion.dev).

### Export to Git LFS
When bidirectional sync is turned on, all files will be pushed to your Git repo, including files that are configured
to be stored in Git LFS. This means that if you have a large number of files in your Diversion repo, you might hit
the storage limits of your Git repo provider. To avoid this, consider turning off bidirectional sync.

### Cost considerations for initial import
When importing a Git LFS repo, the files in the LFS storage will be downloaded to your Diversion repo. This might be
counted against your LFS bandwidth quota, depending on your Git LFS storage provider.

### Cost considerations for bidirectional sync
If you choose to continuously sync your Diversion repo with your Git LFS repo, keep in mind that your Git storage
costs might increase, as you add more files to your Diversion repo. Consult with your Git repo
provider's pricing for cost estimation. To minimize costs, consider disabling bidirectional sync.

### Performance considerations for bidirectional sync
There is a key difference between how Diversion works and how Git LFS works. Diversion continuously syncs your files
to the cloud, while Git uploads files only when you push changes. This means that if you have a large number of files
to commit in your Diversion repo, with bidirectional sync turned OFF the operation is usually instantaneous - the files
are usually already in the cloud by the time you commit them. With bidirectional sync turned ON, the files will have
to be pushed to your Git repo first, which might take a while. This is a server-to-server operation, so it might
still be faster than pushing the files from your local machine, but it's something to keep in mind.
