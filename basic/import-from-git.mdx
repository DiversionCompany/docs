    <Steps>
      <Step title="Enable Diversion Sync">
        Go to the [Diversion Sync GitHub App page](https://github.com/apps/diversion-sync) and follow the instructions to install it.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Go to your dashboard">

      <Step title="You'll be prompted to choose your import options">
        <Image src={'/images/import-repo-options.jpg'} alt="Import repo options modal" />

        Choose whether you want to import your entire repo and keep all of its history, or just the latest commit from a specific branch.

        If you choose to `Import all branches with history`, you'll have the option to `Enable continuous bi-directional sync`.
        This will keep your Git repo and your Diversion repo in sync - this is a great way to take Diversion for a test ride with no commitment!
