Importing an existing repo from Git can get you quickly up and running with Diversion.
You can also enable bi-directional sync between your Git repo and Diversion, so that
changes made in either place are reflected in the other.
This is a great way to take Diversion for a test drive with no commitment.

    To import a repo using the Web UI, follow these steps:
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Enable Diversion Sync">
        Go to the [Diversion Sync GitHub App page](https://github.com/apps/diversion-sync) and follow the instructions to install it.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Go to your dashboard">

        Choose whether you want to import your entire repo and keep all of its history, or just the latest commit from a specific branch.

        If you choose to `Import all branches with history`, you'll have the option to `Enable continuous bi-directional sync`.

  <Tab title="CLI">
    To import a repo using the CLI, follow these steps:
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Enable Diversion Sync">
        Go to the [Diversion Sync GitHub App page](https://github.com/apps/diversion-sync) and follow the instructions to install it.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Open a CLI terminal">
        Open your terminal of choice.

        <DvShellHowTo />
      </Step>
      <Step title="Import">
        Run the following command:
        ```bash
          dv import [git_url]
        ```

        This will start importing your repo into Diversion with the default name - the same as the repo's name in Git.

        There are several optional arguments for the `import` command. You can always run `dv help import` to see them in the terminal.
        <AccordionGroup>
          <Accordion title="[repo-name]">
            Passing a repo name to the `import command` will save the repo to Diversion with that name, instead of the repo's name in Git.
            ```bash
              dv import [git_url] [repo-name]
            ```
          </Accordion>
          <Accordion title="--with-sync">
            Enables bi-directional sync between your new Diverson repo and your Git repo. This means that any change you make to one repo will be reflected in the other.
            
            This is useful for testing Diversion or for keeping any Git-based pipelines you have in place.
            
            ```bash
              dv import [git_url] --with-sync
            ```

          <Accordion title="--git-branch">
            By default, Diversion will import the latest commit from the default branch of your Git repo. If you want to import the latest commit from a different branch, you can use the `--git-branch` flag.
            ```bash
              dv import [git_url] --git-branch [branch-name]
            ```
          </Accordion>
          <Accordion title="--with-history">
            By default, Diversion will only import the latest commit from the default branch of your Git repo. If you want to import the entire repo with all of its history, you can use the `--with-history` flag.
            ```bash
              dv import [git_url] --with-history
            ```
