You have a project set up, and want to add your team members? Here's how:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the repo's menu and choose 'Repo Collaborators'">
    It could be the local workspace or the remote repo. Both work.

    If you don't have a repo yet, [create one first](/basic/start-using-diversion).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter the email">
    Also choose the access level you want to grant. Admins can invite other members.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Click `Invite`" />
</Steps>

That's it! Your team members will receive invitation emails to join the project. If they don't have Diversion installed yet, they'll be prompted to do so.
They can accept the invitation and start working with you. If they need any help, [send them here](/basic/get-existing-project).
