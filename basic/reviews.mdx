## What are Reviews?

Code reviews in Diversion let you request feedback on your changes before merging them into your main branch. Team members can review your code, leave comments, approve changes, or request modifications.


## How Reviews Work

A review compares two refs (branches or commits) in your repository:

- Base ref: The target where changes will be merged (e.g., master)
- Compare ref: The branch or commit containing your changes

When you create a review, Diversion calculates the differences between these two refs and presents them to your team for feedback.

## Creating a Review

There are three ways to create a review in Diversion:

### Method 1: Create Review from Branch (Most Common)

Use this when you want to compare two branches and get feedback before merging.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Navigate to Reviews section**
   - Open your repository in Diversion web app
   - Click on the **"Reviews"** icon in the top header bar

2. **Click "Create new review" button**

3. **Select branches to compare**
   - **Base branch**: Select the branch you want to merge INTO (usually `master`)
     - Click the dropdown under "Base branch"
     - Choose your target branch (e.g., `master`, `main`, `develop`)
   - **Compare branch**: Select the branch WITH your changes
     - Click the dropdown under "Compare branch", or start typing to search for a branch
     - Choose your feature branch (e.g., `feature/user-dashboard`)


4. **Fill in review details**
   - **Title** (required): Short description of your changes
     - Example: "Add user authentication system"
   - **Description** (optional): Detailed explanation
     - Explain WHY you made these changes
     - Mention any important context


5. **Add reviewers** (optional)
   - Click the "Reviewers" dropdown
   - Select one or more teammates who should review your changes
   - You can skip this and add reviewers later

6. **Click "Create review"**
   - The review will be created immediately
   - Assigned reviewers will receive email notifications
   - You'll be taken to the review page


### Method 2: Create Review from Merge Dialog

Use this when you're ready to merge but need approval first

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Navigate to the branch you want to merge**
   - Go to the **"Branches"** section in Diversion web app
   - Find your feature branch (the one WITH your changes) in the Branches list
   - Click on that branch and choose the merge direction
   - Notes: You cannot merge the branch you're currently on. You must click on a different branch to see merge options

2. **Choose "Create review request"**
   - A dialog appears asking how you want to proceed
   - You'll see two options:
     - **"Create review request"**: Request review before merging
     - **"Preview merge"**: See merge diff without creating review
   - Click **"Create review request"**
   <img src="/images/reviews/create-review-merge-2.png" alt="Create review request" />
   - If a review already exists for these branches, click "Go to review requests"
   <img src="/images/reviews/create-review-merge-3.png" alt="Go to review request" />

4. **Fill in review details**
   - If a review already exists for these branches, it will take you there
   - Otherwise, you'll see the review creation form
   - The base and compare branches are already filled in
   - Add title, description, and reviewers
   - Click **"Create review"**


### What You Need for All Methods

Every review requires:
- **Base branch or commit**: Where you want to merge your changes (e.g., `master`)
- **Compare branch or commit**: The branch/commit with your changes
- **Title**: A clear, concise description (required)
- **Description**: More detailed explanation (optional but recommended)
- **Reviewers**: Teammates who should review (optional, can add later)

### Viewing Review Status

**Your status as a reviewer:**
- **REQUESTED** (gray): You haven't responded yet - review is waiting for you
- **APPROVED** (green): You approved the changes
- **CHANGES REQUESTED** (red): You requested modifications

**The review's overall status:**
- **OPEN** (blue): Review is active, may still need approvals
- **MERGED** (purple): Changes were approved and merged
- **CLOSED** (gray): Review was closed without merging

## Working with Review Feedback

### When Changes Are Requested

1. Read through all the comments carefully
2. Make the requested changes on your branch
3. Commit the fixes (they'll automatically show up in the review)
4. Reply to comments to explain what you changed
5. Ask reviewers to take another look

### Updating Your Branch

If you're using a branch review, any new commits you push will automatically appear in the review. Reviewers will see:
- All your original changes
- Any new commits you added to address feedback
- The complete, updated diff

### When You Get Approvals

Once all reviewers have approved (or enough approvals based on your team's policy):
1. Do a final check that everything looks good
2. Merge the changes
3. The review status will automatically change to MERGED

## Best Practices

### Creating Reviews

- **Write clear titles**: "Add user authentication" not "Update files"
- **Explain context**: Use the description to explain WHY you made these changes
- **Keep changes focused**: Smaller reviews are easier to review thoroughly
- **Assign the right reviewers**: Pick people familiar with the code you're changing

### Giving Feedback

- **Be specific**: Point to exact lines and explain what should change
- **Be constructive**: Suggest improvements, don't just criticize
- **Distinguish priorities**: "This must be fixed" vs "Nice to have"
- **Respond promptly**: Don't leave people waiting for days

### Receiving Feedback

- **Don't take it personally**: Code review is about the code, not you
- **Ask questions**: If feedback is unclear, ask for clarification
- **Be open to suggestions**: Sometimes there's a better approach
- **Say thanks**: Reviewing takes time and effort
