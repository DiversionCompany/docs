    <Steps>
      <Step title="">
        Open the Diversion Desktop App and navigate to the main page.

      </Step>

      <Step title="">
        Select the "Create from Existing Folder" option.

        In the "Selected Path" prompt, navigate to the root directory that contains the project you want Diversion to create a repository from.

        Click on "Create" and Diversion will start tracking this directory as well as creating a cloud repository for you. Diversion will start syncing(uploading) the files and directories.

      </Step>

      <Step title="">
        Your repository should now be listed as part of your cloned repositories, meaning it exists in your local machine as well as in the cloud.

    ## Clone a repo
    <Steps>
      <Step title="">
        Open your command line (or Diversion's interactive command line).

        We recommend navigating (use the ```cd``` command) to the root directory of the project you want to initialize.
      </Step>

      <Step title="">
          Run the Diversion ```init``` command.
      ```bash
      dv init <path> <repo_name>
      ```

      ```<path>``` is the local path of the directory you want to initialize as a Diversion repository. If your terminal is in the root, you can simply type ```.```.
      
      ```<repo_name>``` is the name you want your repository to have. If you don't specifity it, the repository name will be the name of the root folder of your project.
