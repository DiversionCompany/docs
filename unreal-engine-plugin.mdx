## Usage

Let's go over a common workflow using the plugin.

For this, we'll be using a clean Unreal project with the plugin already installed and configured.

### Make a change

This project will one day be our Multiplayer Open World RPG With Crafting and Building Mechanics&trade;.

For that, we'll need a character. Let's create one. In your `Content Browser`, right-click and choose `Blueprint Class`.

In the window that appears, choose `Character` and name it `MyCharacter`.

You'll notice that the new file might not be what you're used to - it now has a yellow question mark on it. This is because Unreal Engine just created the file in-memory, and hasn't saved it to the disk yet, so Diversion doesn't know about it.

Let's fix that - double-click on the file to open it, and then click on the `Save` button on the top-left.

The question mark should now be gone, and instead we have a green plus sign. This means that the file is now being tracked by Diversion, and it recognizes that this is a newly added file.

### Commit the change

We want to save this change to our repository, to have it backed up and to be able to share it with our team.

Click again on the `Revision Control` button on the bottom-right, and then click on `Submit Content`.

In the window that appears, you'll see a list of all the files that have changed since the last commit. In this case, you'll see `MyCharacter` with a green plus sign next to it.

In the text box labeled `Changelist Description`, write a brief description of the changes you're committing. In this case, you could write `Added MyCharacter`.

Click on the `Submit` button, and the green plus will disappear, meaning that Diversion has committed the file.

### Let's see this in the Web UI

Open your browser and go to [Your dashboard](https://app.diversion.dev). Find your repository and click on `View Repo`.

You'll see the commit you just made, with the description you wrote, and the file you added.

### Make another change

Our character is just an empty collider right now, so let's add a placeholder mesh so that we can see it.

In the `MyCharacter` blueprint, click on the `Add Component` button on the top-left, and then search for `Cube` and add it. Now we can see our character.
But our character doesn't do anything. In your character's `Event Graph`, add a `Print String` node and connect it to the `Event Begin Play` node. Now our character has some basic functionality.

Save the file.

After saving the file, open your `Content Browser` and you'll see that `MyCharacter` now has a red checkmark next to it. This means that Diversion recognizes that the file has changed.

### Make another commit

Just like before, click on the `Revision Control` button on the bottom-right, and then click on `Submit Content`.
You'll see the `MyCharacter` file with a red checkmark next to it. Double click on it to see the changes you've made in Unreal's diff tool.

You can see the static mesh you added, and the blueprint change you've made.

After reviewing your hard work, write a brief description of the changes you're committing. In this case, you could write `Adding placeholder mesh and basic functionality to MyCharacter`.

Click on the `Submit` button, and the red checkmark will disappear, meaning that Diversion has committed the file.

### Getting changes from others

If you're working with a team, you'll want to get the changes they've made to the project. To do this, click on `Tools` in the menu bar, and then click on `Sync Content`.
