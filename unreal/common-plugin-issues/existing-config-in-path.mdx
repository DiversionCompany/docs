If you're trying to initialize a Diversion repository in your Unreal Engine project, but you previously had a Diversion workspace in the same folder, you'll see following error:

<img src="/images/plugin-issue-config-exists-error-popup.png" alt="Config exists in path popup error" />

This error means that our agent recognizes a `.diversion` folder in your project path, but does not recognize a corresponding repository in our servers. There are 2 possible causes for this:
1. Your project is stored in a detachable drive. This means that you expect the repo to exist. In this case, you should try to reattach the workspace through the button in the desktop app.
2. You deleted the remote repo but not the local `.diversion` folder. This means that you expect the repo to not exist. In this case, you should delete the `.diversion` folder and try again.
