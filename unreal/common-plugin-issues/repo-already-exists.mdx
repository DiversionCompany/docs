title: 'UE Plugin - Repo already exists'
description: '"You already have a repository with the same name"'

If you're trying to initialize a Diversion repository in your Unreal Engine project, but you already have a repository with the same folder name, you'll see following error:

<img src="/images/plugin-issue-repo-exists-init-modal.png" alt="Repo exists in path modal with error" />

You have a few options to resolve this.
1. If you don't want the existing remote repo, you can delete it. Be careful! This cannot be undone.
2. If you don't want the new local project, you can instead clone the repo using the desktop app.
3. If you want to keep both, you can rename the new local project's root directory and try again. In this case, you should also rename your `.uproject` file and [regenerate your project files](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/how-to-generate-unreal-engine-project-files-for-your-ide).
