## Generate an API Token

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the tokens page">
    ðŸš§ Coming soon ðŸš§
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate a new token">
    Hit the _Create Token_ button. Provide your login credentials, if prompted.
    You will be redirected to see your new API Token. Use the _copy_ button to copy the token and paste it somewhere.
    This is the only time you'll see the token here and there'll be no way to retrieve it later.
    If you lose it, you will have to revoke it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Set up your CI/CD platform

### Store the Diversion client ID
Store it as an environment variable named `USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID` with the value `769th1pmk6r3d9t6ari1piu3ds`.<br/>
It will be read and used by the `dv` client in the workflow.

Here are some relevant docs for storing environment variables in popular CI/CD platforms:
* [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/docs/set-environment-variable/#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-project)
* [TravisCI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/)
* [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/typed-parameters.html#How+to+Create+a+New+Parameter)
* [Bitrise](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/builds/environment-variables.html)

### Store the API Token securely
<Note>Don't store the API Token as a plain environment variable! If your CI/CD platform provides a secure
secret storage, use it.</Note>
Here are some relevant docs for storing secrets in popular CI/CD platforms:
* [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/docs/security-recommendations/)
* [TravisCI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#defining-variables-in-repository-settings)
* [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/hashicorp-vault.html)
* [Bitrise](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/builds/secrets.html)

If your platform doesn't support secure secrets handling, you can use external secret handling tools:
* [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) (has a plugin for TeamCity)
* [Akeyless](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/akeyless-overview) (has a plugin for TeamCity)
* [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/key-vault) (has a plugin for TeamCity)
* [Google Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/secret-manager)
* [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/)

## Create a build step
### Install the Diversion client, authenticate it and clone your repo
In your CI/CD step editor or `yml` file, create a new _Shell_ build step with the following content:
<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac/Linux
# Download Diversion client
curl -sL https://get.diversion.dev/unix | bash ; export PATH="$HOME/.diversion/bin:$PATH"
# Authenticate Diversion
dv authenticate $API_TOKEN
# Clone your repository and wait for sync to complete
dv clone -new-workspace my-repository
cd my-repository
dv status
```

```powershell Windows
# Download Diversion client
& ([Scriptblock]::Create((Invoke-RestMethod "https://get.diversion.dev/win")))
# Authenticate Diversion
dv authenticate $API_TOKEN
# Clone your repository and wait for sync to complete
dv clone -new-workspace my-repository
cd my-repository
dv status
```

</CodeGroup>
<Note>Replace `$API_TOKEN` with the appropriate way to reference your secret from the secure storage.
Consult your platform's docs and the secure storage docs.</Note>
<Note>Replace `my-repository` with the name of your repository.</Note>
<Note>`dv status` will block until all the files are downloaded. This is important before starting to work.
It will also output the workspace ID if you want to reuse it for the next runs or view it in the web app.</Note>
<Note>`-new-workspace` will create a new workspace for each run of the CI/CD workflow. Passing a workspace argument here
is important, or else the clone command will prompt for user input and block. See `dv help clone` for details.</Note>

## Add the rest of your CI/CD workflow

That's it. You're all set to use your Diversion repo in your CI/CD workflow. You can also use any CLI commands you would
use with `dv` when running locally.
