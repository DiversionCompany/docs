# Webhooks

Diversion supports webhooks to notify external services when events occur in your repositories. This enables integration with CI/CD systems, notification services, and custom automation workflows.

## Overview

Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that are triggered by specific repository events. When an event occurs, Diversion sends a POST request to the configured endpoint URL with event details in the request body.

### Key Features

- **Event-driven notifications**: Real-time notifications for repository events
- **Secure delivery**: HMAC-SHA256 signature verification for request authenticity
- **Reliable delivery**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **Flexible configuration**: Subscribe to specific event types per webhook
- **Admin-only management**: Repository admin access required

## Supported Events

Currently, Diversion supports the following webhook events:

| Event | Description | Payload |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `commit_created` | Triggered when a new commit is created | Commit details, repository info, author |

## Managing Webhooks

Webhooks can be managed through the web application. Access requires repository admin permissions.

### Web Interface

Navigate to **Settings → Webhooks** for repository-specific webhooks

### Creating a Webhook

1. Click **"Create Webhook"**
2. Fill in the webhook details:
   - **Name**: Descriptive name for the webhook
   - **Description**: Optional description of the webhook's purpose
   - **Endpoint URL**: HTTPS URL where events will be sent
   - **Secret**: Webhook secret for signature verification (auto-generated if not provided)
   - **Events**: Select which events should trigger the webhook
3. Click **"Create"** to save the webhook

### Webhook Secret

The webhook secret is used to generate HMAC-SHA256 signatures for request verification. Secrets must be:
- Between 24-75 characters long
- Stored encrypted in the database
- Only visible during webhook creation

**Auto-generation**: If no secret is provided, Diversion generates a cryptographically secure 32-byte secret in the format: `whsec_<base64-encoded-random-bytes>`

## Webhook Payload

All webhook payloads follow a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_1234567890",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-17T12:34:56.789Z",
  "type": "v1.repo.commit.created",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific data
  }
}
```

### Commit Created Event Payload

```json
{
  "id": "evt_2KtGQeeJhtF5qQ",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-17T08:23:15.123Z",
  "type": "v1.repo.commit.created",
  "data": {
    "repository": {
      "id": "dv.repo.12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc",
      "name": "my-project",
      "owner_id": "Google_12345678901234567890"
    },
    "commit": {
      "id": "dv.commit.123456",

        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com"
      },
      "parents": ["dv.commit.123455"]
    },
    "correlation_id": "abc123-def456-ghi789"
  }
}
```

## Request Signature Verification

All webhook requests include signature headers for verification:

- `webhook-id`: Unique message identifier
- `webhook-timestamp`: Request timestamp (Unix epoch in seconds)
- `webhook-signature`: HMAC-SHA256 signature (format: `v1,base64signature`)

### Signature Verification Example

Diversion provides a reference implementation for webhook signature verification. Here's an example in Python:

```python
import base64
import hashlib
import hmac

def verify_webhook_signature(webhook_id, webhook_timestamp, sig_header, secret, payload_body):
    # Svix signature format: v1,base64signature
    if not sig_header.startswith('v1,'):
        print(f"Invalid signature format: {sig_header}")
        return False
    
    # Extract the signature part after v1,
    v1_signature = sig_header[3:]  # Skip "v1,"
    
    # Use raw hex format directly as the signing key
    try:
        # Svix uses the literal hex string as UTF-8 bytes for signing
        signing_key = secret.encode('utf-8')
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to encode secret: {e}")
        return False
    
    # Construct the signed content according to Svix docs
    # Format: {id}.{timestamp}.{payload}
    signed_content = f"{webhook_id}.{webhook_timestamp}.{payload_body.decode('utf-8')}"
    
    # Compute HMAC-SHA256
    computed_hmac = hmac.new(
        signing_key,  # Use the hex string encoded as UTF-8 bytes
        signed_content.encode('utf-8'),
        hashlib.sha256  
    ).digest()
    
    # Base64 encode the result
    expected_sig = base64.b64encode(computed_hmac).decode('utf-8')
    
    # Compare signatures
    is_valid = hmac.compare_digest(expected_sig, v1_signature)
    
    if is_valid:
        print("Svix signature verified successfully")
    else:
        print(f"Signature verification failed. Expected: {expected_sig}, Got: {v1_signature}")
    
    return is_valid
```

**Note**: A fully tested webhook validation implementation is available as an AWS Lambda function example. [Contact support](mailto:support@diversion.dev) if you need assistance with webhook signature verification.


## Webhook Delivery

Diversion ensures reliable webhook delivery with the following features:

- **Automatic retries**: Failed deliveries are retried with exponential backoff
- **Delivery tracking**: Monitor webhook delivery status
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents overwhelming destination servers
- **Circuit breaking**: Temporarily disables failing endpoints

### Delivery Guarantees

- Webhooks are delivered at least once
- Events may arrive out of order
- Use the `timestamp` field for event ordering
- Implement idempotent handlers using the `id` field

## Testing Webhooks

To test your signature verification implementation:
1. Create a test webhook with a known secret
2. Use the example validation code provided above
3. Compare against the reference AWS Lambda implementation

## Best Practices

1. **Use HTTPS endpoints**: HTTP endpoints are not supported for security
2. **Verify signatures**: Always verify webhook signatures in production
3. **Handle retries**: Make webhook handlers idempotent
4. **Respond quickly**: Return 2xx status within 30 seconds
5. **Queue processing**: For long-running tasks, queue work and respond immediately
6. **Monitor failures**: Set up alerts for webhook delivery failures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook not triggering**
   - Verify the webhook is active
   - Check event type subscriptions
   - Ensure you have admin access to the repository

2. **Signature verification failing**
   - Confirm you're using the correct secret
   - Verify timestamp is within tolerance (5 minutes)
   - Check signature format and parsing

3. **Delivery failures**
   - Ensure endpoint is publicly accessible
   - Check for SSL/TLS certificate issues
   - Verify endpoint returns 2xx status code
   - Review server logs for errors

### Debugging Tips

- Use webhook testing tools like [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) for initial testing
- Enable debug logging in your webhook handler
- Test with curl using the expected payload format
- [Contact support](mailto:support@diversion.dev) if you need help investigating delivery issues

## Security Considerations

1. **Secret management**: Store webhook secrets securely, never in code
2. **Payload validation**: Validate all webhook data before processing
3. **Rate limiting**: Implement rate limiting on webhook endpoints
4. **Authentication**: Use webhook signatures as the only authentication method
5. **HTTPS only**: Always use HTTPS endpoints for webhook delivery

## Discord Webhook Integration

    - At the moment, direct Discord webhook integration is not supported. However, you can still connect Discord using a middleware service such as Zapier or Pipedream, which act as bridges between Discord and our platform.

### Using Pipedream to Integrate Discord Webhooks

1. **Set Up Pipedream**
    - Create a Pipedream account and a new project
    - Name your project and click **Create Project**

2. **Create a Workflow**
    - Click + **New** → choose **Workflow**
    - Name your workflow, uncheck "Send error notifications", and click **Create Workflow**

3. **Add a Trigger**
    - Click **Add Trigger** → select **New HTTP / Webhook Requests**
    - Click **Save and Continue**

4. **Add Discord Action**
    - Click the **+** symbol below your trigger → search and select **Discord**.
    - Choose **Send Message**
    - Select your Discord account
    - Log in to Discord and select your server and channel
    - Enter your message (e.g., "New commit!") and close the action
    - Here is a template for a more detailed message that includes the repo name, author, branch, commit id, commit message and a link to the commit:
    ```
        **New Commit to {{ JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(steps.trigger.event.body)).data?.repository_name || 'Unknown Repo' }}**

        **Author:** {{ JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(steps.trigger.event.body)).data?.author?.full_name || 'Unknown Author' }}
        **Branch:** {{ JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(steps.trigger.event.body)).data?.branch_name || 'Unknown Branch' }}
        **Commit ID:** {{ JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(steps.trigger.event.body)).data?.commit_id || 'Unknown ID' }}
        **Message:** {{ JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(steps.trigger.event.body)).data?.message || 'No message' }}
        **Link:** {{ JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(steps.trigger.event.body)).data?.commit_url || 'No URL' }}
    ```
    - You can customize the message further by accessing other available fields from the commit created event payload

5. **Test & Deploy**
    - Click **Test** to confirm the message appears in Discord
    - Click on the trigger → copy the webhook URL
    - Use this URL as the Payload URL when configuring your webhook in the Diversion app
    - Click **Deploy** to activate the workflow
    - Go to Diversion and paste this URL into Diversion and add the webhook

6. **Configure the Webhook in Diversion**
     - Open the Diversion Desktop App or Web UI
     - Navigate to **Settings** → **Webhooks**
     - Click **Add Webhook**
     - In the **Payload URL** field, paste the webhook URL you copied from Pipedream
     - Fill in the other webhook details
     - Click **Add webhook** to activate the webhook
