## Create a repo using the webapp

You can start using Diversion without any installations!

<Steps>
    <Step title="Open the app">
        Click Login at the top of this page
    </Step>
    <Step title="Sign up">

    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a repo">
        Click on Create New Repository
        ![New Repo](/images/create-repo.jpg)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Name the repo">
        Give your new repo a name and click Create
        ![Repo Name](/images/repo-name.jpg)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Use your new repo">
        You will be taken to a tutorial that takes you through installation instructions, to work from your local machine. You can skip
        those if you only want to use the webapp. Simply select the new repo from the dropdown menu at the top:
        ![Select Repo](/images/select-repo.jpg)
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Upload a file to your repo

Uncommitted work is stored, and synced across devices, in workspaces. To start adding content to your repo:
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="laptop-file" title="Create a workspace">
    Select Create New Workspace from the Branch dropdown at the top. Give it a name and click Create.
      ![Create Workspace](/images/branch-dropdown.jpg)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="folder" title="Create directory">
      Optionally, create a directory in your workspace to add hierarchical structure to your repo.
      ![Create Directory](/images/create-folder.jpg)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="upload" title="Upload content">
    There are two simple options for uploading content to your workspace from the webapp:
      1. Drag and drop a file from Finder/Explorer into the left pane of the webapp
      ![Drag and drop a file](/images/drag-drop.jpg)
      2. Click the Upload icon
      ![Upload file button](/images/upload-button.jpg)
    Then select a target directory for your file and click Upload:
      ![Select directory](/images/select-directory.jpg)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Commit your changes

After uploading some content or making changes to a workspace, we probably want to commit and make the content
accessible in the branch we are working on.
Simply type a commit message describing your changes, select the files to commit, and click Commit:

    <Step title="Open the repo settings">
