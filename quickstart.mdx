{/* ## Create a repo using the webapp

You can start using Diversion without any installations!

<Steps>
    <Step title="Open the app">
        Click Login at the top of this page
    </Step>
    <Step title="Sign up">

    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a repo">
        Click on Create New Repository
        <Image src={"/images/create-repo.jpg"} alt={"Create Repo"} />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Name the repo">
        Give your new repo a name and click Create
        <Image src={"/images/repo-name.jpg"} alt={"Repo Name"} />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Use your new repo">
        You will be taken to a tutorial that takes you through installation instructions, to work from your local machine. You can skip
        those if you only want to use the webapp. Simply select the new repo from the dropdown menu at the top:
        <Image src={"/images/select-repo.jpg"} alt={"Select Repo"} />
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Upload a file to your repo

Uncommitted work is stored, and synced across devices, in workspaces. To start adding content to your repo:
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="laptop-file" title="Create a workspace">
    Select Create New Workspace from the Branch dropdown at the top. Give it a name and click Create.
      <Image src={"/images/branch-dropdown.jpg"} alt={"Create Workspace"} />
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="folder" title="Create a directory">
      Optionally, create a directory in your workspace to add hierarchical structure to your repo.
      <Image src={"/images/create-folder.jpg"} alt={"Create Directory"} />
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="upload" title="Upload content">
    There are two simple options for uploading content to your workspace from the webapp:
      1. Drag and drop a file from Finder/Explorer into the left pane of the webapp
      <Image src={"/images/drag-drop.jpg"} alt={"Drag and drop a file"} />
      2. Click the Upload icon
      <Image src={"/images/upload-button.jpg"} alt={"Upload file button"} />
    Then select a target directory for your file and click Upload:
      <Image src={"/images/select-directory.jpg"} alt={"Select directory"} />
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Commit your changes

After uploading some content or making changes to a workspace, we probably want to commit and make the content
accessible in the branch we are working on.
Simply type a commit message describing your changes, select the files to commit, and click Commit:
<Image src={"/images/commit.jpg"} alt={"Commit"} />

## Share your repo with a collaborator

Inviting someone to collaborate on a repo is simple:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to the repos page">
        Click the sloth icon at the top left corner, or [click here](https://app.diversion.dev)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Open the repo settings">
        Click the gear icon next to the repo name
        <Image src={"/images/repo-settings.jpg"} alt={"Repo Settings"} />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Invite via email">
        Enter your collaborator's email at the bottom of the modal, select the access level to grant, and click Send invite
    </Step>
</Steps> */}
