        Your newly created repository is now listed both in the Cloned Repositories and All Repositories sections. Cloned, means it exists in your machine and you can start using it locally.

        Open a terminal and run:

        ```bash
        curl -sL https://get.diversion.dev/unix | bash ; export PATH="$HOME/.diversion/bin:$PATH"
        ```

        To make the path permanent, add it to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

        ```bash
        echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.diversion/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
        ```

        You can now use Diversion entirely through the terminal.

      <Step title="Create an account and login">
        Run the following command to open the WebUI and create your account:

         ```bash
        dv login
        ```
        A browser window will open so you can authenticate. Once logged in, you're good to go!

      </Step>

      <Step title="Create or clone a repository">
        To create a new repository:

        ```bash
        dv create <repo-name>
        ```

       You can also create a repo from an existing local folder:
        ```bash
        dv create <repo-name> <path-to-your-folder>
        ```
        Or clone an existing one you've been added to:
        ```bash
        dv clone <repo-name-or-id> <destination-folder>
        ```


        This creates a new repo and workspace at the current directory.

        </Step>
        
        <Step title="Start working">
        Make changes to your files as usual. Diversion will track your changes in the background.

        To check the status of your changes:

        ```bash
        dv status
        ```

        </Step>

        <Step title="Commit your work">

        Once you're ready to save a version of your progress:

        ```bash
        dv commit -a -m "your commit message"
        ```
        </Step>

        <Step title="Push and sync">

        By default, Diversion automatically syncs committed changes across the team. You don't need to push or pull manually, just commit your work and it gets shared.

        </Step>

        <Step title="That's it!">

        You're now using Diversion on Linux. Everything works through the CLI, and we'll let you know if a GUI becomes available in the future.
