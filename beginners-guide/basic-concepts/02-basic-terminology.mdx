title: 'Basic terminology'
description: "Some essential terminology used in diversion."
---

Source control systems, as they grow in complexity, also grow a set of
terminologies that can be daunting for new users to understand when encountering
them for the first time. This section will cover the basics of some words that
are used in diversion version control. It is not necessary to read this at once,
as this is designed to be a reference. Feel free to use this list as a reference
when you are reading this guide. 

Keep also in mind that some terms might be different on different version
control systems, so be wary about this if you come from another version control
system.

| Repository, repo | This is the group of files and folders that constitute a project that is uploaded in the diversion cloud infrastructure. The remote project hosted in the diversion servers is called like this. You, and all your teammates will usually work on the same repository of a given project by modifying, creating or deleting assets from it. |

* Repository: Also shortened as *repo*, is the group of files and folders that
  constitute a project that is uploaded in the diversion cloud infrastructure.
  The remote project hosted in the diversion servers is called like this. You,
  and all your teammates will usually work on the same repository of a given
  project by modifying, creating or deleting assets from it. 



* Collaborator: Any other person that is not the repository creator with a
  Diversion account that has been given access to a specific repository is
  called a collaborator. Collaborators must be invited by the repository
  creator, and multiple collaborators can be added to contribute to a
  repository. The creator of a repository is also considered a collaborator.
  Collaborator can have different privileges according to the access provided by
  the creator of the repository, from read-only to admin style access.

* Workspace: A workspace is both a local copy of the remote repository, and a
  local cloud space created for you only. The local and cloud workspace its
  exclusive to you only you can see effect modifications on it. A workspace is
  created every time you clone a repository, so you can have multiple workspaces
  for a specific repository. Every collaborator that clones a repository will
  also create a workspace associated with it.

* Branch: A branch is a copy of the state of a repository at a given point in
  time. Created by either the creator or a collaborator. You can create, rename,
  delete and merge branches with either other branches or the "main" branch. The
  "main" branch is usually considered the default branch of a repository.

* Commit: Every file change, or group of file changes saved to a repository by a
  collaborator is called a commit. This is an active command done by any
  collaborator. Usually, commits have a short description explaining what were
  the changes and why they were made.

* Pending changes: Any change done in your local workspace that has not yet been
  saved and persisted in a commit command.

* History: Also known as "commit history" or "commit log", is the series of
  commits created by all collaborators on a repository. Every branch has a
  separate commit history.

* Head: Also known as tip or top. The last entry of a repository.

* Tag: Commits can have a special "tag" that help them identify them easily.
  This is usually done to mark an important milestone of a project that is worth
  to keep in order to easily reference it later.

* Conflict: A conflict is a situation where different collaborators make and
  commit changes to the same file or asset, It must the be_resolved_ by
  combining the changes or selecting which change will be preserved in favor of
  the other.

* Diff: Short for "difference". When comparing two versions of a plain text
  file, either between commit history entries or within a conflict, is the
  specific set of lines that have changed, added or removed between the two
  versions.

* Clone: The act of cloning a repository is to get a copy of the remote
  repository to a local machine.

* Reset: When you have modified files in diversion and got synced in the cloud,
  you may want to restore them to their original state. You can then select
  those files and reset them in your workspace. They will be restored to its
  last commit state and will look as if you have never modified them in your
  workspace. This will not affect the commit history, only the local workspace.

* Revert: Also known as "undo". Sometimes a collaborator decides that a given
  commit was a mistake and want to restore those changes. This is called a
  "revert", and it will bring those changed files back to the workspace and
  change them to the restored state. You can revert files to the state of any
  commit history.

* Merge: When you bring the state of a given branch and decide to apply all the
  changes of that branch to a target branch is called a merge. This will be
  marked as a commit history entry every-time you make one on the merged branch.

* Checkout: When you set a specific workspace to the state of a project at any
  other point on the commit history of a given branch. You usually create a
  checkout on branch, plus a commit ID, which is usually the latest commit
  entry.

* Status: The current status of a given workspace, including its sync state,
  branch and commit you are in, and its currently modified but not yet committed
  files.

* Sync: One of the key features of Diversion is the ability to sync a project
  automatically. Each time you make modifications on a workspace, this changes
  will get synced automatically to your workspace cloud space. Syncing also
  means that every time someone commits a change, and you happen to be in the
  same branch, the changes will sync automatically with your current workspace.
  The sync process can be paused and resumed, but you must have sync enabled if
  you want to eventually commit files.

* Selective sync: In Diversion, it is possible to select only certain files and
  folder to be automatically synced. This can be useful for people who only care
  for a specific part of a repository and don't want to interact with the rest.

* Reattach workspace: When a workspace get moved around, diversion will lose its
  tracking reference to it. You can then "reattach" the workspace from the
  desktop client so it reorients the workspace correctly to the desktop app and
  be able to continue working on the new location.

* Support bundle: If you ever encounter an issue with Diversion, we'd love to
  hear about it! We usually request a support bundle, which compiles a series of
  log files that can be used for us to check the status of diversion and check
  for error or warning messages.

* Text files: Some files are simple plain text files that you can open with a
  standard text editor. There are called text files and have special status in
  version control systems.

* Binary files: As opposed to text files, these are files that need specialized
  programs to be opened, and cannot be easily understood by opening them in a
  simple text editor. Binary files also have a special distinction and treatment
  in version control systems.

* Intermediary files: Files that are generated in the course of a project but
  are not needed to keep integrity of a project. They are considered transient,
  temporary and usually locally generated by each collaborator in a project.

* Ignore file: A specialized file that is designed to add file and folder patter
  for version control systems to ignore. There are especially useful to ignore
  unnecessary temporary and intermediate files so it won't bloat the project and
  avoid trouble when collaborating with others.

* Mono-repo: A term used for a style of projects that has a fixed number of
  collaborators for a given time, and don't usually receive collaboration from
  the public. Monorepos are usually repositories handled by companies who have
  fixed projects that come and go. Usually companies like game development or
  simple private applications work in a mono-repo style of work.
