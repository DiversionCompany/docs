Welcome to diversion! You ar eprobably interested in using Diversion as a
version control system for your projects.

This guide will serve as a starting point for every beginner 
user who wants to learn about diversion version control.

The objective of this guide is to learn about the Diversion tooling, basic
tenets, best practices and the philosophy behind Diversion. This guide should
also help you decide if diversion is the right tool for your project.

## Who is this guide for?

This guide assumes that you know little about source control systems, or that you
come from other types of cloud storage systems (such as Dropbox or Google Drive),
and want to learn about source control from the start.

If you already know some concepts or have used version control systems before, 
you can skip some part of this guide and just focus on the diversion tooling 
aspects, these aim to be more in-depth that the quick-start guide and aim to explain 
a bit the philosophy behind some decisions made on diversion.

We hope you enjoy reading this guide!
