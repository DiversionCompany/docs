description: 'A basic explanation of the Diversion tools'
---

Starting from here, we will focus more on how Diversion actually works and
understandding the different technical elements are in your system. All of these
elements interact with each other and form part of the main Diverison local
toolset.

// TODO: GRAPHIC

## The Diversion local agent

The local Diversion agent, also known as dv (asthe name of the executable
dv.exe) is the main element of all things Diverison related. The agent usually
automatically starts when your computer starts and works in the background. 

The local agent main functions focus on making all diversion elements work,
mainly:

* Scanning your unpaused workspaces for any files changes.
* Syncing these workspace changes with their respective remote cloud space
* Downloading any new files that come from commits on the current branch your
  workspace is in.

Diversion will always keep working in the background, and no element of
Diverison will be able to function is the local agent is not running.

Ususally the local agent will update itself and auto restart. So to keep it up
to date usually don't have to do anything, with the exception of maybe
ocasionally reboot your system in case an update cannot be installed wihile the
agent is running.

If the agent crahes or fails for any reason, it will also atempt to restart
itself. This is not alway succesful though but the main dEsktop application will
always try to check if the agent is running and warn you if it's not. Running
the CLi will always start the agent if the agent is down.

## The Command Line Interface, or CLI

The Diversion command line interface, or CLI, is the interactive part of the
local agent process. You can run it by opening a terminal in your operative
system and simply typing _dv_.

// TODO: GRAPHIC

The dv is the active user part fo our toolset. You can perform every single
command that Diverison allows you to, incuding:

* Create repositories from scratch, or clone exisiting ones
* Commiting files
* Create, renameand destroy branches
* Merge a given branch onto another
* Check the status of a given workspace
* And many more features

The CLI has a terminal interface that can help you with a list of available
commands, with explanation on what it does and the parameters it receives. 

Its is important to not that the list of commands available will change depdngin
fi you are inside a worksapce or not. If you are inside a workspac you will be
able to perform different commands that you won't be able to do outside and vice
versa. In other words, the dv CLI is sensitive to the folder you are in and only
some commands will work if you are inside a repsoitroy folder

// TODO: GRAPHIC SHOWIG DIFF IN COMMANDS 

If you want ot now more about the commands what they doe, you can also look at
the CLI API docs.

// TODO URL TO API

Now for a regular user, the CLI can be a bit complicated to use, so we have
created various frontends that can help you use a grpahical interfaceto deal
with these commands in a friendly maner. All the graphical forntends will
interact with the CLI internally so you don't need to rely on it for every task.

## The Desktop app

The first piece of forntend we will look the the Desktop app. Thsi will be
probably the tool you will use the most, and its the main point of entry for
Diversion as a whole.

// TODO :GRAPHIC

You will do most of your operations here and will the control center of all
Diversion operations related, including the interaction of all your local
workspaces.

There is a more in depth explanation of the Desktop App in this [section]()

## The Web UI

There is an alternative to teh desktop application, and its the Web UI. You can
access this UI through the Diversion website, ad requieres the same credentials
as the desktop app.

The UI and operatiosn are almost the same. The main difference though is that,
since its a web ui app ony, you cannot do specific ooperations realted to local
workspaces. But the rest of functionality is available within the Web
application.

## Integrations plugins

Diversion has aditional plugins that can connect to additional services or
programs. These are designed to give additional support specific to a certain
platform of software tools.

Read the section fo integratiosn to know more about the eixsing integrations
plugins.

## The .dvignore file

This is a particular element of the Diverion toolset because this is not a tool
per se, but a file located in your main wrokspace and repository project.

Sometimes, projects that use certain applicatiosn will generate a lot of files
that are only necesary in a limited situation and are temporary. Think of
interemdiate files, build settings, elements that are generated when building,
etc.

These files can generate unnecesary conflicts with other collaborators since
they tend to be unique per computer and can actually cause mor hamr if they are
synced between collaborators. Not to mention that they cause bloat and thus
severely increase the size and bandwith of your repository.

This means that version control systems need to devise a way to "filter out"
unwanted or unneded files and only leave the essential in the repository.
Diversion is no exception to this and that is why we created the dvignor file.

This is a file that every repository will create at the start called ".dvignore"
(notice the dot at the beginning). This has a list if files, folders and pattern
to ignore before committing anything.

The syntax is identical to github's with some additions.  So a good
recommnedatio it to read how the .gitingroe file works (TODO: Add gitignore
syntax link)

The dvignore file that Diversion creates already has patterns for some popular
game engines (i.e. Unity, Unreal and Godot), but depending on your type of
project, you may need to actively edit this file before comitting files on your
repository.

If you have already committed files and the want to ignore them after the fact.
You will need to edit the dvignore files and then _you must delete the comitted
files_. Comitted files will never be applied by the dvignore filter unless they
are removed from the repository itself.
