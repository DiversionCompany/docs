In Diversion, and in verison control in general, there are recommended ways to
work in order to get the best fo what you can achieve with these types of
software. Thsi section of this guide will explain what are the technical Steps

First, we must understand what a basic workflow in Diversion looks like. You cna
check this diagram to understand the basics.

## Diversion Workflow Steps Explained

### Modify files

Given a task you have at hand in your project, you wil add, delete or modify
files or elements in your project.

### Sync

This is an important step in Diversion and the ones that makes the difference
between other systems. Your project will exists locally in your computer, but it
will also exists ina a cloud space created by diversion. 

This will auto-sync and update/delete/modfiy items that you have done yourself
locally, or items that haven changed by other users __and committed them to the
project__.

This can have great advantages, including the fact that if yourcomputer has a
local problem, the remote worksapce will keep your local modified files and
won't be lost. The sync step is automatic (to be more precise, it preform a
check every 5 second to see what files Diversion needs to sync), you don't have
to do anything for it to happen.

You can pause/resme syncing if for any reason you don't want to have auto sync
to work. But you must always have sync enabled in order to commit.

There can be other reasons for Diversion to automatically pause the sync proces,
whic are explaind in another section-

### Commit

The commmit step is the step where any change you have donde in your project
will be recorded in Diversion, and add it to a history log of your project.

You must add a comment to the commit, explaining briefly what you changed in the
project for others (and yourself) to be able to see later what the changes were.

## The main difference between Diversion and other version control systems

The main difference between Diversion and other control systems is the __sync__
step. The fact that it is automatic and will constalyt update your projectas
others commit.

In other version control systems, there is no sycn step and they do one of two
things, depending on the software:

* You commit directly to the repository space.
* You "stage and your changes" locally in your computer, then you upload your
  changes to the space (usually called "push").

Both workflows won't let you commit your changes unless you download (or _pull_)
changes first. This means to donwload first the commits created by others before
you can commit yours. The automatic sync system in Diversion will do this step
automatically for you.

### Automatic syncing and collaboration

Diversion, by defualt, will always auto sync your workspace with the cloud space
on the branch that you are the
following:

* Any local changes you do on the project.
* Any __commits__ and __merges__ you, or your collaborators effect on that
  branch.

This step is always automatic. Sync check ocurr aproximately every 5-10 seconds
your machine and, unless there is a conflict or your system blocks files, this
will auto update your workspace.

Some people find thisa very convenientes process on collaborating, particularly
artsis working with image assets and using Diversion as a sort of cloud space
depot. But some people do find this intrusive and want only to receive updates
one a task they set themselves is done and want to avoid intrivuse files popping
in your current work

### Pause/resume sync

You can manually pause syncing, this will stop you and then resume sync. Fro
some this can help them concentrat eonly on the feature they are working on and
then update everything

// TODO: GRAPHIC

Although pausing/sincyng is a thing you can do in Diverison. We recommned doing
things in a different manner, involvng the use of branching. You can read our
[Diversion recommended collaboration strategies](___) to learn more about it.

### Other reasons for a paused workspace

Sometimes the automatic syncing process will stop on a given workspace. There
are several reasons of why might happen:

* You have manually paused syncing.
* There are files that mayb be blocked by a specific application, preventing
  them to be manipulaed by the syncing agent.
* There was a failure in the internet connection for a while.
* There is something wrong either with our syncing features. Usually this might
  pause your worksapces as a protective measure.
* Some other potential unknown problem

The first two points can be handled by you. You can either resume syncing, of
try tofind what application might be locking some files so they cannot be read
or modified by anone else. Game Engines, like Unreal for example, are known for
doing this, so trying to close the application, or specific panels that might be
sugin the blocked files might help you resume syncing.

You may also try to "rescan" your project. This sometimes ghelps the sync agent
find files that might have been ommitted for some reason (for example, fast hard
drive interactions removing and adding temporary files might confuse the agent
trying to sync files that are not there anymore).

// TODO: GRAPHIC

The last three points might be something out of your control. I those case, it
might be usfule to contact us either via email or the discord server to aks for
help. We will do our best then to troubleshoot your isues and find a
satisfactory solution for you.

### Selective syncing

Some collaborators may only wan to work on certain parts of a given project and
don't want tosnc every piece of data of a specific project. A common example of
this are artiss that onyl work on raw assets loalted ina  special folder in the
repository, wheres they won't, or don't want to interatce with the resto fot eh
project.

You can configure a specific worksapce to only sync specific folder witihn the
Diversion Desktop app. By selecting the workspace settingsin your app you ca
select onyl the folder you want to sync. Th rest will be ignored and wont' be
accounted when syncing, merging and committing.
