You've made some changes to your project - created new files, modified existing ones, or deleted some. Now what?

## Review your changes

In the desktop app, go to your repo. On the left, under `Workspace`, you should see the files you've changed.
<img src="/images/changes-view-workspace.png" alt="View changes in workspace" />
Each change is marked with an icon and a color. You can always hover over the icon to see what change was made - added, modified, deleted, or moved (which includes renaming).

The buttons on the top let you change the way you see your list of changes. Choose one you like.

When you click on a file you changed, if it's in a supported format, it will open in the main panel. Right now Diversion supports text files and images.
Use the button on the top to switch to `Diff View` to see the changes you made.
