You're about to start a new project. How exciting!
What you want is a Diversion repository. Let's get you set up from the get-go:

<GoToUnreal />

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new repository">
    In the desktop app, click on the `New Repository` button on the top right.
    <img src="/images/new-project-init-repo.png" alt="Initialize a new repo" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a folder for the repo">
    You can create a new folder or use an existing one. If you have a clean, empty game-engine project, you might want to choose its root folder.
    In this example I'll create a new folder, but the other steps work the same either way.
    I'll select `Create New Folder`and call it `CreatingNewRepo`.
    <img src="/images/new-project-create-new-folder.png" alt="Create a folder for the repo" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'Create'" />
  <Step title="Syncing">
    A new repo is created in the folder you specified! The icon on the top left says it's syncing - that is, it's uploading the folder's content to our cloud.
    In this example it's an empty folder so it should only take a moment.
    <img src="/images/new-project-repo-is-still-syncing.png" alt="Repo is still syncing" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Good to go!">
    When the icon looks like this, you're all set!
    <img src="/images/new-project-repo-done-syncing.png" alt="Repo is ready" />
  </Step>
</Steps>

{/* TODO(omer s): mention .dvignore here when we have a page for it */}
And that's it! You have a new repository. Anything you do in the directory will be tracked by Diversion.
