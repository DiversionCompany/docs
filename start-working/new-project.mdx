You're about to start a new project. How exciting!
Here's how you can set it up with Diversion from the get-go:

<GoToUnreal />

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new repository">
    In the desktop app, click on the `New Repository` button on the top right.
    <img src="/images/new-project-init-repo.png" alt="Initialize a new repo" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new folder for the repo">
    With `Create New Folder` selected, give it a name and choose a location. I'll call it `CreatingNewRepo`.
    <img src="/images/new-project-create-new-folder.png" alt="Create a folder for the repo" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click `Create`" />
  <Step title="Syncing">
    A new repo is created in the folder you specified! The icon on the top left says it's syncing, but since it's an empty folder it should only take a moment.
    <img src="/images/new-project-repo-is-still-syncing.png" alt="Repo is still syncing" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Good to go!">
    When the icon looks like this, you're all set!
    <img src="/images/new-project-repo-done-syncing.png" alt="Repo is ready" />
  </Step>
</Steps>

And that's it! You have a new directory. Anything you add to the directory will be tracked by Diversion.
