You want to work on a project with your team, but you don't want to step on each other's toes.
No worries! There's a way to work on your project in parallel without interfering with each other's work, and then recombine it all together when you're done.
It's called branching and merging.

## Branching
You can think of a branch as a separate version of your project. 
When you create a branch, you're creating a copy of your project at that point in time.

### Creating a new branch
<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the 'new branch' button'">
    This is in your workspace view.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a branch name">
    Give your branch a name that describes what you're working on.
    Also, pay attention to the commit you're branching from - this will be the base for our new branch.
    You can automatically switch to the new branch after creating it by leaving the checkbox checked, it is by default.

    Hit 'Create' when you're ready.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Switching branches
In your workspace view, you can see a list of your branches.
You can see the branch you're currently on at the top of the list.
Click the menu for the branch you want, and select "Switch to branch".

If you have any changes in your workspace that you haven't committed, they will move with you to the new branch, if possible (see [Merge conflicts](#merge-conflicts) below).

### Important things to remember
1. Working on any branch is just like working on your main branch. Making changes, committing, syncing - it's all the same.
2. Branches are visible to anyone in your repo, and anyone can switch to any branch.
3. The committed changes on the branch are only available to team members who are on the same branch.

## Merging
When you're done working on your branch, you can merge it back into your main branch.
Merging takes all of the changes from one branch and applies them to another.

### How to merge
In the same workspace view, you can choose the branch you want to merge and choose the option you want from the menu.

If there are no conflicts, you should see a new merge commit in your branch history.

### Merge conflicts
Sometimes, the changes you made on your branch conflict with the changes someone else made on another branch.
When you try to merge these branches together, you'll have to decide how to handle these conflicting changes.
