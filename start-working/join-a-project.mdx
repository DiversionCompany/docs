A team member has [set up Diversion](/start-working/start-using-diversion) for your project and [invited you to join](/start-working/add-people-to-your-project). Let's get you set up:

<Steps>
  <Step title="In the app, under 'All Repositories', you should see the repo">
    <img src="/images/join-project-all-repos.png" alt="All repos" />
    Click on `Clone Repo`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a folder">
    A new folder with the repo's name will be created in it (here - `DiversionExample`).
    <img src="/images/join-project-clone-repo.png" alt="Clone a repo" />
    Click `Clone`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The project should start downloading right away. When it's done, you can open it and start working!
