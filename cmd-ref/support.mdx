If you ever encounter an issue with Diversion, we'd love to hear about it!

One way to let us know about your issue is to run the following command from any directory:

```bash
dv support
```

You will be prompted to add an issue description. Depending on whether you run the command from the Interactive Diversion Shell or from a regular Command Line, you'll see slightly different results.

With the Interactive Shell:
```bash
Add your issue description here or choose 'Abort' option from the menu:
```

With a regular CLI:
```bash
Please enter the issue description:
  Use (ctrl+c) to Abort.
  Press double enter to finish.
```

When describing your issue, please be as specific as you can so we can be as efficient as we can in solving it.

Running this command sends us a support bundle with your issue description and your user, so we can reach out if necessary.

Also, you can always reach out to us directly on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/HDAGJvgkuT). We might ask you to run this command ;)
