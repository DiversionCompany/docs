Checkout a branch, commit, or tag to your current workspace.

```bash
dv checkout <ref> [--take-changes] [--shelve-changes] [--discard-changes] [--apply-shelf] [--ignore-shelf]
```

```<ref>``` is the only mandatory parameter and the options are:

```<branch_name>```, or ```<branch_id>``` if you want to checkout a branch.

```<commit_id>``` or ```<tag_id>```, if you're checking either of them.

When checking out, there might be some local pending changes or incoming shelved changes. You can specify what to do in each case:

```[--take-changes]``` If your worskpace contains any changes, take them with you to the checked out target.

```[--shelve-changes]``` If your workspace contains any changes, shelve them for later use.

```[--discard-changes]``` Discard any changes in the workspace.

```[--apply-shelf]``` If the branch to be checked out contains any previously shelved changes, un-shelve them after check out.

```[--ignore-shelf]``` If the branch to be checked out contains any previously shelved changes, ignore them and don't prompt to apply them.
