The branch command allows you to manipulate branches: creating, deleting, and renaming.

## Create a branch

To create a new branch, run:
```bash
dv branch -c <branch-name> [-no-checkout]
```
A new branch `branch-name` will be created. If the flag `-no-checkout` is _not_  passed, the new branch will be
checked out.

The branch_name has to be a unique identifier, not named after any other existing branch.

Uncommitted changes will be transferred to the newly created branch.

## Delete a branch
To delete a branch, run:
```bash
dv branch -d <branch-name>
```
For convenient autocompletion of the branch name, run the CLI in interactive mode.

This command deletes the branch with the given id as parameter, the ID in this case is the branch’s name.  

The `–f` flag is optional and suppresses the confirmation dialog for deleting the branch.


## Rename a branch
```bash
dv branch -r <branch_id> <new_name> 
```

The new name parameter has to be a unique identifier, not previously used for any other branch.
