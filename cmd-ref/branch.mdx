## Create a branch

To create a new branch, run:
```bash
dv branch -c <branch-name> [-no-checkout]
```
A new branch `branch-name` will be created. If the flag `-no-checkout` is _not_  passed, the new branch will be
checked out.

TODO: Elaborate about uncommitted changes.

## Delete a branch
To delete a branch, run:
```bash
dv branch -d <branch-name>
```
For convenient autocompletion of the branch name, run the CLI in interactive mode.
