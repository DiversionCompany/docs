## Change working directory

Similarly to your OS' terminal, `cd` allows you to switch the working directory for the Diversion CLI.

```bash
dv cd <directory>
```

The `<directory>` parameter is the path you want to move to.

For example, if you want to move to your Documents directory, you would type:

```bash
dv cd /Users/Sloth/Documents/
```
