The repo command allows you to list the repositories you have cloned locally and those you’re a collaborator of. This will list your repositories.

```bash
dv repo
``` 

To delete a repository:

```bash
dv repo -d <repo_id> [-f]
```

The `-f` flag will suppress the confirmation message.

This command will delete the repository from the cloud and unlink your local directory as a Diversion repository.

Be careful with this action; there’s no way to recover deleted repositories.
