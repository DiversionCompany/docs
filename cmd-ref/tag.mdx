title: 'tag'
description: ''

In Diversion, you can tag commits for easier reference of particular commits. 

```bash
dv tag [-sub-command] [--json]
```

To create a new tag:

```bash
dv tag -c <name> [-a <description>] [--ref <commit_id>]
```

The above command will create a new tag with the name `<name>`, and optionally, you can add a description `[-a “Tag description”]`.

You can also provide the `commit_id` explicitly, or by default, the current commit will be tagged.

To delete a tag:

```bash
dv tag -d <tag_id> [--f]
```

The tag ID must be Diversion’s ID, not the tag name.
