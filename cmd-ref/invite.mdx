To add contributors to your repository, you use the invite command:

```bash
dv invite <email> –access <mode>
```

`–access <mode>` defines the level of access you want to provide to this collaborator; the options for `<mode>` are:

* `READ`
* `WRITE`
* `ADMIN`
* `OWNER`

The collaborators need a Diversion account before they can access the repository.
