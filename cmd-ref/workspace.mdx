The workspace actions you can take with this command are create, delete, rename, and switch.

If you want to list your workspaces, use the following:

```bash
dv workspace
```

To create a new workspace(with a default name) and switch to it:

```bash
dv workspace â€“-new
```

To create a new workspace with a specified name and switch to it:

```bash
dv workspace --named <name_of_new_workspace>
```
To rename your current workspace:

```bash
dv workspace --rename <new-name>
```

To delete the specified workspace:

```bash
dv <workspace_id> --delete
```

You cannot delete the current workspace. The `<workspace_id>` is not the workspace name but the id that starts with `dv.ws.xxxxx`

To any action, you can add the `-f` flag to avoid getting asked to confirm.
