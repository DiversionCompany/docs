The workspace actions you can take with this command are list, delete, and rename.

If you want to list your workspaces, use the following:

```bash
dv workspace
```

To rename your current workspace:

```bash
dv workspace rename <new-name>
```

To delete the specified workspace:

```bash
dv workspace delete <workspace_id>
```

You cannot delete the current workspace. The `<workspace_id>` is not the workspace name but the id that starts with `dv.ws.xxxxx`

To any action, you can add the `-f` flag to avoid getting asked to confirm.
