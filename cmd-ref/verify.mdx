Verify the filesystem integrity compared to multiple sources of truth.

```bash
dv verify [--mirror <mirror>] [--intact]
```

`--mirror` is the path to an un-versioned local directory that should reflect the expected contents of the workspace.

`--intact` if set, verify all items in tree are intact (without modifications).
