```bash
dv clone <repo_id> <path> [--workspace <workspace_id>] [--new_workspace]
```

If no path is provided, the cloned repository will be cloned under the current directory in a new folder with the same name as the repository.

The `<workspace_id>` has to be the id that starts with ws., not the name.

You can provide the workspace you want to use after the clone by providing the `<workspace_id>` with the `--workspace` flag.

You can use the `--new_workspace` parameter to force the creation of a new workspace. If you donâ€™t provide this parameter, Diversion will ask you to confirm.
