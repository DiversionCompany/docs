In Diversion, you call the commit command to add the changes in your active workspace to the active branch. 

```bash
dv commit <files> [-a] -m <commit_message> 
```

You can specify which files to commit individually or use the `[-a]` parameter to commit all the changes. 

A commit message is required preceded by the `-m` flag. The commit message needs to be “surrounded by quotes.”

An example on how to add all the files to a commit would be:

```bash
dv commit -a -m "Implemented running animations."
```

Once committed, the changes will be replicated across all users on the same branch.
