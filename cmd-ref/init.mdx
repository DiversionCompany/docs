The init command initializes a Diversion repository from your local drive. Diversion will create a cloud project with the provided parameters.

```bash
dv init <path> <repo_name> [--f]
```

The path is the location where you want Diversion to initialize your project. If you want to initialize in the current directory, provide `.` as the parameter.

You can define the repository's name (which will appear in the web dashboard). If no name is specified, Diversion will take the last path component of the directory.
