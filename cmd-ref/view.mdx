Run the following command inside of a Diversion repository:

```bash
dv view
```

This will open Diversion's web UI for the current repository.

## Make sure you're in a repository
This command only works when the curret working folder is in a Diversion repository. Running it in any other folder results in the following error:

```bash
Current directory is not a diversion repository (neither is any of its parent directories).
```
