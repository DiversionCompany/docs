You use the log command to get the list of commits in your repository. Optionally, you can indicate the number of results you want to get displayed in the terminal using the `-n <num_results>` parameter.

```bash
dv log [-n <num_results>] 
```

An example of fetching the last ten commits is:

```bash
dv log -n 10 
```
