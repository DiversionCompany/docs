This command allows you to import your Git project (currently, only GitHub over HTTPS URL is supported).

```bash
dv import <git_url> <repo_name> [--with_sync] [--with_history] [--git_branch <git_branch>]
```

The `<git_url>` is the URL from your GitHub repository. Optionally, you can provide a `<repo_name>` if you want Diversion to name it differently than the repository you are importing.

You can tell Diversion to keep your repository synced with the Git repository (changes in either will be propagated to the other). Use the `[--with_sync]` parameter if you need this.

You can tell Diversion to import either the repository's head (the latest commit) or the entire repository’s history. Specify this using the `[—-with_history]` parameter.

You can also indicate which branch you want to import or all the branches. By default, Diversion will import the default branch.
