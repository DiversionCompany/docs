description: 'Get the syncing status'
---

This command shows your project's syncing status. It also contains the working tree directory, which includes the repository, branch, workspace, and commit youâ€™re in.

```bash
dv status [--sync-only] [--nowait]
```

You can specify if you want to see only the sync status using `--sync-only`.

And whether you want it to wait for sync to complete before displaying the details `--no-wait`.
