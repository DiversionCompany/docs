[We’re working on Diversion’s desktop app, which means you will be able to ]

This section is the reference for Diversion’s CLI commands. For in-CLI help, check the [help command](help/).

To run Diversion on your computer, follow our [Getting Started Guide](../quickstart).

You can type the commands directly into your terminal or shell; append `dv` followed by the command, parameter, and flags.

```bash
dv status
```

We recommend using the interactive CLI to get autocompletion and avoid typing `dv` every time.

You just need to type `dv`.

This will open the interactive CLI; from now on, you just need to enter the commands followed by parameters and flags.

```bash
clone <repo_name>
```
