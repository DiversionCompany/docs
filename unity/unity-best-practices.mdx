---

Unity works seamlessly with Diversion, providing powerful version control for your game projects without the complexity of traditional VCS systems. While there isn't a dedicated Unity plugin yet, Diversion fully supports Unity projects through its desktop app and CLI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before setting up Diversion with Unity, ensure you have:
- Diversion installed and signed in (see [Quickstart](/quickstart))
- Unity Hub and Unity Editor installed
- Your Unity project created or ready to import

### Initial Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Unity for version control">
    Open your Unity project and navigate to `Edit > Project Settings`:

    - Set **Version Control Mode** to `Visible Meta Files`
    - Set **Asset Serialization Mode** to `Force Text`

    <img alt="Unity Project Settings" style={{width: '90%', borderRadius: '1.5rem', border: '.3rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} src="/images/unity-project-settings-vcs-meta.jpg" />
    <img alt="Unity Project Settings" style={{width: '90%', borderRadius: '1.5rem', border: '.3rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} src="/images/unity-project-settings-vcs-force-text.jpg" />
    These settings ensure Unity's meta files are visible to Diversion and that assets are stored in a text-based format for better conflict resolution.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify .dvignore configuration">
    <Card title="Note" icon="info-circle" iconType="duotone" color="#0b8a42">
      Diversion automatically creates a `.dvignore` file with Unity-specific patterns when initializing a Unity project. You typically don't need to modify it.
    </Card>

    The default `.dvignore` for Unity projects includes common patterns like:

    ```ini
    # Unity generated (automatically included)
    /[Ll]ibrary/
    /[Tt]emp/
    /[Oo]bj/
    /[Bb]uild/
    /[Bb]uilds/
    /[Ll]ogs/
    /[Uu]ser[Ss]ettings/

    # Visual Studio cache
    .vs/

    # Gradle cache
    .gradle/

    # Autogenerated VS/MD/Consulo solution and project files
    ExportedObj/
    .consulo/
    *.csproj
    *.unityproj
    *.sln
    *.suo
    *.tmp
    *.user
    *.userprefs
    *.pidb
    *.booproj
    *.svd
    *.pdb
    *.mdb
    *.opendb
    *.VC.db

    # Unity3D generated meta files
    *.pidb.meta
    *.pdb.meta
    *.mdb.meta

    # Unity3D generated file on crash reports
    sysinfo.txt

    # Builds
    *.apk
    *.unitypackage
    *.app
    *.exe

    # Crashlytics generated
    crashlytics-build.properties

    # OS generated
    .DS_Store
    Thumbs.db
    Desktop.ini
    ```

    You can add project-specific patterns if needed, but the defaults cover most Unity use cases.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize Diversion repository">
    Open the Diversion desktop app and create a new repository from your Unity project folder, or initialize via CLI:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/unity/project
    dv init
    ```

    Diversion will automatically recognize your Unity project structure and begin tracking the appropriate files, including the appropriate `.dvignore` patterns.

    <Note>
      For detailed instructions on creating repositories, see the [Quickstart guide](/quickstart) or [Basic repository operations](/basic/create-a-repo).
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make your first commit">
    After initialization, commit your Unity project:

    ```bash
    dv commit -m "Initial Unity project setup"
    ```

    Remember: with Diversion, this single command handles everything - no need for separate add, commit, and push commands!

## Essential Unity-Diversion Workflow

### Meta Files Management

<Card title="Critical Rule" icon="exclamation" iconType="duotone" color="#ca8b04">
  Always commit meta files together with their corresponding assets. Missing meta files will break asset references and cause errors for your team.
</Card>

Unity generates `.meta` files for every asset containing crucial information like:
- **GUID** (Globally Unique Identifier) for asset references
- Import settings and configurations
- Platform-specific settings

**Best Practices:**
- When adding new assets, ensure both the asset AND its `.meta` file are committed together
- If you see missing script references or broken prefabs, check if meta files were properly synced
- Never manually edit or delete meta files outside Unity

### File Operations

<Card title="Important" icon="triangle-exclamation" iconType="duotone" color="#ca8b04">
  Always perform file system operations (move, rename, duplicate, delete) through the Unity Editor, never through your OS file explorer.
</Card>

When Unity moves or renames files, it:
- Updates all internal references automatically
- Maintains GUID connections in meta files
- Ensures project integrity

**Correct workflow:**
1. Open Unity Editor
2. Use the Project window to rename/move/delete assets
3. Save the project (`Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`)
4. Commit changes with Diversion

## Scene Management & Conflict Prevention

### Leverage Diversion's Conflict Prevention

Unlike Git, Diversion proactively prevents conflicts before they happen:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check for potential conflicts">
    Before editing a scene, open the Diversion desktop app and look for the **exclamation mark icon** (!) in the file tree. This warns you when someone else is currently editing the same files.

    <img alt="Potential Conflicts Warning" style={{width: '90%', borderRadius: '1.5rem', border: '.3rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} src="/images/branching-and-merging-merge-warning-icon.png" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Communicate with your team">
    If you see a potential conflict warning, coordinate with your teammate before making changes. Diversion's real-time notifications help you avoid stepping on each other's toes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Scene Organization Best Practices

<Accordion title="Use Multi-Scene Architecture">
  Break large levels into multiple smaller scenes that load additively:

  ```csharp
  // Load scenes additively at runtime
  SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync("Environment", LoadSceneMode.Additive);
  SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync("Lighting", LoadSceneMode.Additive);
  SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync("Gameplay", LoadSceneMode.Additive);
  ```

  Benefits:
  - Multiple team members can work on different aspects simultaneously
  - Smaller scenes = fewer conflicts
  - Better performance through selective loading
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Maximize Prefab Usage">
  Convert reusable game objects into prefabs:

  - Use **Prefab Variants** for different configurations of the same object
  - Leverage **Nested Prefabs** for complex hierarchies
  - Edit prefabs in isolation using Prefab Mode

  This reduces scene file changes and makes conflicts easier to resolve when they do occur.
</Accordion>

## Daily Workflow Best Practices

### 1. Start Your Day Right

Open the Diversion desktop app to:
- Check for any uncommitted changes from your previous session
- Look for exclamation marks (!) on files you plan to edit (potential conflicts)
- See recent commits from your team in the commit history

```bash
# Or use CLI to check your workspace status
dv status
```

### 2. Commit Frequently

With Diversion's instant sync, frequent commits benefit everyone:

- **After creating new features**: New scripts, prefabs, or materials
- **After scene changes**: Level design updates or lighting adjustments
- **Before switching tasks**: Keep work organized and traceable
- **End of day**: Never leave uncommitted changes overnight

### 3. Write Meaningful Commit Messages

Good examples:
- "Add player jump mechanic with double-jump support"
- "Update level 3 lighting and post-processing"
- "Fix enemy AI pathfinding in narrow corridors"

Avoid:
- "Updated stuff"
- "Bug fix"
- "WIP"

### 4. Handle Large Assets

Diversion excels at large files, so you can:

- **Use higher quality assets**: Keep uncompressed source files alongside compressed versions
- **Store multiple texture resolutions**: Maintain 4K/8K textures without worrying about file size
- **Include uncompressed audio**: Store both WAV/FLAC masters and compressed formats for different platforms
- **Create comprehensive atlases**: Build larger, more efficient texture atlases without VCS limitations
- **Version binary files freely**: PSDs, FBX files, and other large assets are handled as efficiently as code

## Team Collaboration

### Branch Strategy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Feature branches for major changes">
    Create branches for significant features or experiments:

    ```bash
    dv branch create feature/new-inventory-system
    ```

    Branches in Diversion are instant and lightweight, regardless of project size.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Work in isolation">
    Make your changes without affecting the main branch. Diversion's auto-sync keeps your branch updated.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and merge when ready">
    Once your feature is complete and tested, use Diversion's built-in review feature to get feedback from teammates before merging.

    Open the Diversion desktop app to create a review and merge your branch when approved.

    <Note>
      Learn more about code reviews and the review workflow in the [Review documentation](/concepts/reviews).
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Missing Script References

**Problem**: "The associated script cannot be loaded"

**Solution**:
1. Check if the script's `.meta` file was committed
2. Verify the GUID in the meta file matches prefab references
3. If missing, have the original creator commit their meta file

### Broken Prefab Connections

**Problem**: Prefab shows as disconnected or missing

**Solution**:
1. Never modify prefab files outside Unity
2. Use Prefab Mode for all prefab edits
3. If broken, revert the prefab and reapply changes through Unity

### Scene Conflicts

**Problem**: Two people edited the same scene

**Solution**:
1. Use Diversion's potential conflict warnings to prevent this
2. If it happens, coordinate to manually merge changes
3. Consider breaking the scene into smaller subscenes

## Best Practices Summary

<Card title="Do's" icon="check" iconType="duotone" color="#0b8a42">
