<Card title="Using the Diversion Interactive Shell" icon="lightbulb" iconType="duotone" color="#ca8b04">
  If you want an interactive shell with nicer UI, open your terminal of choice and run the `dv` command.
  It works the same as your regular terminal, and you can use any of the `dv` commands (`commit`, `init`, etc...) directly without prefacing them with `dv`.
