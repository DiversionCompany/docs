## Using the CLI

Diversion offers two modes to work with the CLI, classic and interactive. In classic mode, use it as any other terminal
tool - type the command with the appropriate arguments and execute it. To use the interactive mode, run `dv` and you will
be presented with a friendly interface with suggestions and auto-completion, so you don't have to memorize commands.

## Get a copy of your repo

You can either create a new repo, or clone an existing repo. Clone means different things in different versioning systems,
in Diversion clone means getting a local copy of some branch via a workspace, and keeping this copy synced bidirectionally
with the cloud.

  <Accordion icon="sparkles" title="Create a new repo">
    `cd` to the directory where you want a new repo created (a new sub-directory will be created), then run:
      ```bash
      dv init [dir_name]
      ```
      which will create both a directory and a repo named `dir_name`. To use different directory and repo names:
      ```bash
      dv init [dir_name] [repo_name]
      ```
      If you're in interactive mode, the CLI will automatically `cd` to the new directory and you can start working.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="clone" title="Clone an existing repo">
      If you have previously created a repo (either from the web app or the CLI on another machine), and want to sync it
      locally, run:
      ```bash
      dv clone [repo_name]
      ```
      which will create a directory named `repo_name` where the contents will be synced to. To use a different name
      for the directory, run:
      ```bash
      dv clone [repo_name] [dir_name]
      ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Commit your changes

After uploading some content or making changes to a workspace, we probably want to commit and make the content
accessible in the branch we are working on. Assuming all files are required for the commit, run:
```bash
dv commit -a -m "[commit message]"
```
Alternatively to only commit some of the files, run:
```bash
dv commit [[file1] [file2] ...] -m "[commit message"
```

## Share your repo with a collaborator

Inviting someone to collaborate on a repo is simple even from the CLI:
```bash
dv invite user@example.org
```
which will grant write access to the repo to the invitee. To share with different permissions run:
```bash
dv invite -access [READ|WRITE|ADMIN|OWNER] user@example.org
```
