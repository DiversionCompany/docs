**Repositories**

By default your workspaces are synced in full, but there will be cases when you might want to:

- pause temporarily the syncing of your workspace.
- just sync a subset of your workspaces.


**Pause workspace sync**

You can temporarily pause syncing for any workspace through the desktop app:

Go to Settings > Pause sync
Confirm to pause syncing for the current workspace

While paused:

Your local changes are preserved and you can continue working
Remote commits from other team members won't sync to your workspace
Your commits won't be pushed to the repository

This is useful when you need to work offline or want to prevent interruptions during intensive work sessions. Remember to resume syncing when you're ready to collaborate again.

**Selective sync**

Control exactly which folders sync to your local workspace through Settings > Selective sync.
How it works:

Checked folders: Contents sync locally, including all subfolders
Unchecked folders: Won't sync locally
Partially checked folders: Only checked subfolders will sync
Previously synced folders: Will be deleted locally if unchecked

Important notes:

Selective sync settings apply only to the current workspace
Settings cannot be changed while you have pending changes—commit or stash first
Each workspace can have different selective sync configurations

This feature is particularly useful for large repositories where you only need specific assets or code sections for your current task.

**Sync Conflict Detection**

We’ve introduced a new mechanism to help you manage sync conflicts more smoothly.

If your workspace was paused or out of sync while others made commits to the same branch—and you edited the same file without syncing—your version of the file will now be automatically backed up locally with a .dv-conflict suffix.

To resolve these changes, simply use your preferred local diff tool to compare the versions, apply your edits to the original file path, and commit once you’re ready.

This helps ensure you don’t lose your changes and keeps your workflow efficient.
