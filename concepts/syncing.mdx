## Repositories

By default your workspaces are synced in full, but there will be cases when you might want to:

- pause temporarily the syncing of your workspace.
- just sync a subset of your workspaces.


## Pause workspace sync

You can temporarily pause syncing for any workspace through the desktop app:

Go to Settings
<img style={{width: '350px', height: '54px', borderRadius: '0.5rem', border: '.1rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} src="/images/syncing/SettingsMenu.png" alt="Diversion's Desktop App Settings Button" />

Pause sync
<img style={{width: '182px', height: '136px', borderRadius: '0.5rem', border: '.1rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} src="/images/syncing/PauseSyncMenu.png" alt="Diversion's Desktop App Pause Sync" />

Confirm to pause syncing for the current workspace
<img style={{width: '264px', height: '145px', borderRadius: '0.5rem', border: '.1rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} src="/images/syncing/ConfirmPauseSyncMenu.png" alt="Diversion's Desktop App Confirm Pause Sync" />

While paused:

Your local changes are preserved and you can continue working
Remote commits from other team members won't sync to your workspace
Your commits won't be pushed to the repository

This is useful when you need to work offline or want to prevent interruptions during intensive work sessions. Remember to resume syncing when you're ready to collaborate again.

## Workspace Automatic Update

<img style={{width: '87px', height: '49px', borderRadius: '0.5rem', border: '.1rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} src="/images/syncing/AutoForwardingToggle.png" alt="Diversion's Desktop App Workspace's Auto-Update Toggle" />

While sync pause/resume controls the syncing between your local copy to the cloud workspace, auto-update controls the merging of new commits from the shared branch into your cloud workspace.

<div style={{width: '80%', margin: '0 auto'}}>
    ```mermaid
    flowchart TD

    G[Local Workspace Updated] --> H{Sync Status}
    H -->|Resumed| I[Local changes automatically synced with cloud workspace]
    H -->|Paused| J[No sync to / with cloud workspace]

    A[Remote Branch Commit] --> B{Auto-Update}
    B -->|Enabled| C[New commits automatically merged to cloud workspace]
    B -->|Disabled| K[No sync with cloud workspace]
    C --> H{Sync Status}
    ```
</div>

#### How it works:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Card title="Auto-Update ON" icon="toggle-on">
        Remote commits to the current branch will be automatically merged to the cloud workspace.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Auto-Update OFF" icon="toggle-off">
        Remote commits to the current branch will **not** be automatically merged to the cloud workspace.

        In case of remote commits to the branch, a notification "Pending workspace updates" will be displayed.
    </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>Toggling auto-update from off to on will trigger an automatic workspace update in case of pending updates.</Note>

#### When should I turn it off?

In most cases it is better to be in sync with the remote branch, it allows finding and fixing conflicts fast and to avoid complex merges in the future.

Turn it off if you don't want remote branch updates to automatically be synced into your cloud workspace, for example if you think that changes from other teammate's might break your current project state.

#### Alternative

It is possible to branch-out to a side branch in order to avoid constant syncing between local workspace and remote branch commits.

## Selective sync

Control exactly which folders sync to your local workspace through Settings.
<img style={{width: '350px', height: '54px', borderRadius: '0.5rem', border: '.1rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} src="/images/syncing/SettingsMenu.png" alt="Diversion's Desktop App Settings Button" />

Selective sync
<img style={{width: '182px', height: '136px', borderRadius: '0.5rem', border: '.1rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} src="/images/syncing/SelectiveSyncMenu.png" alt="Diversion's Desktop App Selective Sync" />

Check (for sync) or uncheck (for unsync) the desired directories
<img style={{width: '308px', height: '200px', borderRadius: '0.5rem', border: '.1rem solid #555', boxShadow: '0 0 1rem #888' }} src="/images/syncing/ConfirmSelectiveSyncMenu.png" alt="Diversion's Desktop App Confirm Selective Sync" />

How it works:

Checked folders: Contents sync locally, including all subfolders
Unchecked folders: Won't sync locally
Partially checked folders: Only checked subfolders will sync
Previously synced folders: Will be deleted locally if unchecked

Important notes:

Selective sync settings apply only to the current workspace
Settings cannot be changed while you have pending changes—commit or stash first
Each workspace can have different selective sync configurations

This feature is particularly useful for large repositories where you only need specific assets or code sections for your current task.

## Sync Conflict Detection

We’ve introduced a new mechanism to help you manage sync conflicts more smoothly.

If your workspace was paused or out of sync while others made commits to the same branch—and you edited the same file without syncing—your version of the file will now be automatically backed up locally with a `.dv-conflict` suffix.
This helps ensure you don’t lose your changes and keeps your workflow efficient.

## The `.dv-conflict` Files

These files are only created to indicate conflicts and are not intended to be committed to the repository.
Hence, they are not tracked by Diversion and you can't commit them.

They will show up in your workspace in the Diversion desktop app with a warning, and you will be able to view their contents, but with no history.
You can continue working and committing as usual with the rest of your files, including the original file that was conflicted.
However, we recommend resolving conflicts as soon as possible before the differences become too hard to merge.

The `.dv-conflict` files are not automatically deleted, so you should delete them yourself once you resolve the conflicts.
It is currently not possible to delete them through the Diversion desktop app, but you can do so manually from your file explorer.
Use the context menu item _Show in Explorer/Finder_ to quickly locate the file and delete it.


## Resolving Sync Conflicts

If this is an Unreal Engine resource, such as `uasset`, then it'll be impossible to open both versions inside the editor
due to broken redirectors in the backed up file (because its name has changed).
Please do the following:

1. Make sure the original file has no changes (if there are, either commit or reset them before dealing with conflicts).
2. Overwrite the original file with the `.dv-conflict` version.
3. After the file is overwritten, you can open it in the editor and review the differences between the two versions.
4. Once you have resolved the differences, you can commit the changes or reset if you don't want them.
5. Delete the `.dv-conflict` file (if you left a copy when overwriting) to clean up your workspace.

For other file types, such as text files or images, the process is as follows:

1. Use your preferred local diff tool to compare the versions, such as Meld, WinMerge, VSCode, etc. or open the files side by side.
2. Apply your edits to the original file path, and commit once you’re ready.
3. Delete the `.dv-conflict` file to clean up your workspace.

If you don't clean up the `.dv-conflict` file, it will remain in your workspace, which may accumulate several conflict backups, e.g. `file.dv-conflict.txt`, `file.dv-conflict-1.txt`, `file.dv-conflict-2.txt`, etc.
